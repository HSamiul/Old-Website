        <p>
          I'm a 17 y/o, born in Bangladesh and raised in New York. I'm a senior at the Bronx High School of Science and plan
          to major in computer science once I'm in college. I aspire to create a large
          impact on the world, one that'll help people. I'm not sure what that impact actually is yet, but this About page will
          be the first/second place to hear about it.

            I participated in MIT's 'BeaverWorks Summer Institute' (BWSI), where
            I developed assistive technology for persons with disabilities.
          </li>
          <li class = "about_achievements_list_items" id="item2">
            I'm the marketing lead for the 'Blockchain for Schools' (BFS) hackathon
            team. Although I'm not a blockchain expert, I'm all about
            facilitating a community for programmers.
          </li>
          <li class = "about_achievements_list_items" id="item3">
            I'm interning for the 'Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra' (BSO). I'm supposed to be
            collecting sponsors, but I'm filling in the third trumpet position in
            freaking concerts instead - not complaining.

      <h1> Things I Enjoy </h1>
        <ul>
          <li class = about_achievements_list_items>
            I love playing my trumpet. My favorite piece to play is "Straight
            No Chaser" by Miles Davis.
          </li>
          <li class = about_achievements_list_items>
            I like making money. I don't have time for a job so I resell on the
            side plus another thing I'm not sure I'm allowed to tell people.
          </li>
          <li class = about_achievements_list_items>
            My absolute favorite thing to do is talking with people. I can be akward,
            so it's a difficult combo, but I'm working on it.
